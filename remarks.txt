**NOTE FOR TUYA USERS:**
Before asking for help with configuration of GPIOs on your newly flashed device, check if you can find the template on <https://blakadder.github.io/templates/>. Read more about templates on <https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Templates>.

**NOTE FOR HOME ASSISTANT USERS:**
Before asking for help with Tasmota/Home Assistant, make sure that both are in the latest available versions.
Be prepared that we will ask if you have verified that the MQTT messages sent from Tasmota device are correct. This can be done using `mosquitto_sub`, `mqtt_spy` or other MQTT clients available for free.
This applies especially for Auto Discovery functions. If the messages are correct, the issue might be related to HA configuration and as such, might be resolved better on the HA Discord: https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e
