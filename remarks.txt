**NOTE FOR TUYA USERS:**
Support is provided ONLY in two cases: a) your device is on the supported devices list (<https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki#supported-devices>) or b) you have already flashed your device and need help with configuration.

**NOTE FOR HOME ASSISTANT USERS:**
Before asking for help with Tasmota/Home Assistant, make sure that both are in the latest available versions.
Be prepared that we will ask if you have verified that the MQTT messages sent from Tasmota device are correct. This can be done using `mosquitto_sub`, `mqtt_spy` or other MQTT clients available for free.
This applies especially for Auto Discovery functions. If the messages are correct, the issue might be related to HA configuration and as such, might be resolved better on the HA Discord: https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e
