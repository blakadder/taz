Hello and welcome to the Tasmota Discord server!

If you have generic questions regarding settings, functionality, or need help with configuration of your device, feel free to ask in the #general channel.
Do you think you've encountered a bug? The device doesn't work as expected? The #issues channel is for such questions.
This is not strictly enforced, however please do not post the same issue in both channels.

**If this software helps you save money which you'd otherwise spend on commercial home automation systems, please consider a donation: <https://paypal.me/tasmota>. Thank you.**

Solutions or suggestions related to common issues and problems, especially for those new to Tasmota and compatible devices, are available on our wiki:

<https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Troubleshooting> (especially this one)

Please keep in mind that we're all volunteers here. Please be polite and patient. While we allow off-topic conversations, the channels are moderated. Flooding the chat, spamming links, being rude etc. is a quick way to be kicked (and/or banned, depending on the case).

Just be a decent human being and we'll all get along just fine.
